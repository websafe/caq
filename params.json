An empty project with [ZendFramework] libraries\r\n\r\nThis will create a project located in directory `./my-example-2` based \r\non nothing (no skeleton application) with [ZendFramework] installed as a\r\n[Composer] package in `./vendor/zendframework`, in other words, a project\r\nwith the pure framework, no application:\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\ncaq myvendor/my-example-2 zf2\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example 3.

A [ZendSkeletonApplication] based project with [ZendFramework] libraries and [ZfcUser] module  \r\n\r\nThis will create a project located in directory `./my-example-6` based \r\non [ZendSkeletonApplication] with [ZendFramework] installed as a [Composer]\r\npackage in `./vendor/zendframework/zendframework` and [ZfcUser] module installed\r\nas a [Composer] package in `./vendor/zf-commons/zfc-user`:\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\ncaq myvendor/my-example-6 zf2-app-zfc-user\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Example 7.

If no packages were defined, skip to next step.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasically, when You don't define a Skeleton Application URI (SA)\r\nand don't define any packages (PKG) You'll end up with an empty\r\nproject, containing:\r\n\r\n\r\n~~~~\r\n + project-name\r\n   + vendor\r\n     + bin\r\n       + composer.phar\r\n     + composer\r\n       + ClassLoader.php\r\n       + autoload_classmap.php\r\n       + autoload_namespaces.php\r\n       + autoload_real.php\r\n     + autoload.php\r\n     + .gitignore\r\n   + .gitignore\r\n   + composer.json\r\n   + README.md\r\n   + LICENSE.md\r\n~~~~\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\ncaq - Composed Application Quickstarter (https://github.com/websafe/caq/)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Thomas Szteliga <ts@websafe.pl>, http://websafe.pl/\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
